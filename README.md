# Outreach_Bot-The_Kaons_7951
A robot designed for teaching kids the basics of programming and robotics.
The obstacle avoidance code could be used to demonstrate how functions work and how to call them. A presenter would go over the structure of the code while other members helped the kids follow along. We or the kids could design an obstacle course for the robots to go through.
The pre-programmed instructions code could be used to create a robot which follows a specified path; however, the motors are somewhat finnicky and don't stop well.
